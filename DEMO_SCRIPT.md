```

study, remote work shows mixed
results - 13% productivity gain
for focused roles, but 7% loss

suggests hybrid approaches may
be optimal.

## Test Arguments for Recording

### Weak Argument 1:
```
Climate change isn't real because it snowed yesterday. Scientists are just
making it up for funding. Anyone who believes in it is brainwashed.
```

### Weak Argument 2:
```
Social media is bad for everyone and should be banned. I don't use it and
I'm fine, so everyone should quit too. Studies don't matter because I said so.
```

### Weak Argument 3:
```
All politicians are corrupt and evil. There's no point in voting.
Everyone knows the system is rigged anyway.
```

### Strong Argument (After Fixing):
```
A 2023 meta-analysis of 47 studies (N=52,000) found that social media use
exceeding 3 hours daily correlates with a 35% increase in anxiety symptoms
among adolescents. However, the same research showed that moderated use
(under 1 hour daily) with parental guidance showed no significant negative
effects. This suggests regulation and education may be more effective than
outright bans.
